# Meteor Survivors Game

Instructions: Use A and D to rotate the ship left and right. Press W to propel the ship forward. Press or hold Spacebar to fire lasers from the ship. Getting hit by a meteor removes one life from your ship.

Goal: Survive for as long as possible. Collect experience dropped from meteors you shoot and destroy to gain upgrades such as increased life points, fire rate, or ship speed. There are hard caps on life points (5) and fire rate (10 shots/sec).

Separate README located in parent folder describing Flocking implementation.
