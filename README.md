Flocking is used to give some animation to experience dropped from destroying small asteroids. Experience orbs will fly towards the player so they are automatically collected instead of the player having to fly and collect them manually. Also adds some interesting progression to the player's xp bar by gradually filling up with each individual orb collected, rather than all at once.
